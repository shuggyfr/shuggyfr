## SOC Analyst Professional Statement
#Include tools, programming languages later on


I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in security operations and threat monitoring. Proficient in multiple programming languages and bilingual, I bring analytical skills and attention to detail to the forefront of incident detection and response. I am highly committed to safeguarding information systems, preserving privacy, and ensuring organizational resilience against cyber threats. Within a Security Operations Center environment, I prioritize efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughnessâ€”whether triaging alerts, investigating anomalies, or supporting incident response. My goal is to contribute to a proactive defense posture by identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats in real time.
