## Cybersecurity
#Include tools, programming languages later on


I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in security operations and threat monitoring. Proficient in multiple programming language, I bring analytical skills and attention to detail to the forefront of incident detection and response. I am highly committed to safeguarding information systems, preserving privacy, and ensuring organizational resilience against cyber threats. Within a Security Operations Center environment, I prioritize efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughnessâ€”whether triaging alerts, investigating anomalies, or supporting incident response. My goal is to contribute to a proactive defense posture by identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats in real time.

1. Topology Setup
	â€¢	Built the network topology with 3 autonomous systems (AS100, AS200, OSPF Area 1 & Backbone).
	â€¢	Assigned hostnames and IP addresses according to the addressing plan.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: Full topology view (like the one you uploaded).

â¸»

2. OSPF Configuration
	â€¢	Configured R1 and R2 to run OSPF, dividing the network into OSPF Area 1 and the Backbone.
	â€¢	Verified routing tables to confirm OSPF adjacencies.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: CLI output of show ip ospf neighbor and show ip route ospf.

â¸»

3. BGP Configuration
	â€¢	Enabled BGP on R2 and R3 to advertise the 222.223.50.0/24 public network.
	â€¢	Established external BGP sessions between AS100 and AS200.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: CLI output of show ip bgp summary.

4. Access Control List (ACL)
	â€¢	Applied ACL to deny all inbound traffic to PC at 192.168.2.1.
	â€¢	Verified ACL rules by testing connectivity before and after ACL deployment.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: CLI of ACL config (access-list, show access-lists).

5. DNS & HTTP Server Setup
	â€¢	Configured Server (192.168.1.3) in AS100 with HTTP and DNS services.
	â€¢	Registered domain name: first_lastname.com.
	â€¢	Configured PCs in 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 to use the DNS server.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: Server config window (DNS entries + HTTP service ON).

â¸»

6. NAT Configuration
	â€¢	Configured Static NAT on R3 to map server 192.168.1.3 â†’ 222.223.50.3.
	â€¢	Configured NAT overload for outbound traffic from 172.16.0.0/16 to reach the internet.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: CLI output of NAT config and show ip nat translations.

â¸»

7. Testing & Verification
	â€¢	Verified web access by browsing to http://first_lastname.com from different PCs.
	â€¢	Confirmed DNS resolution and NAT translation.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot to include: PC Web Browser window showing server page loading successfully.
